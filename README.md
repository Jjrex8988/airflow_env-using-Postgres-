# airflow_env-using-Postgres

## 1. **Installing PostgreSQL “in WSL system” (via apt)**

* You’re installing **system-wide PostgreSQL** using Ubuntu’s package manager (`apt`).
* Binaries (like `psql`, `postgres`) go to `/usr/bin/`.
* The service runs under **systemd/service manager** as background daemon.
* Data lives in `/var/lib/postgresql/...`.
* Port: defaults to **5432**, accessible across the whole WSL instance.
* Managed by root (`sudo` needed).

✅ Good if:

* You want PostgreSQL available for all projects on that WSL machine.
* You’re okay with “real service” semantics (system-wide, always running).

⚠️ Risks:

* Port conflicts (5432 already in use).
* Harder to isolate from other projects (all use the same Postgres instance).
* Mixing system-level packages and conda/pip packages can get messy.

## 2. **Installing PostgreSQL “inside airflow\_env” (via conda)**

* PostgreSQL is installed **only inside your conda environment**.
* Binaries live under `~/miniconda3/envs/airflow_env/bin/`.
* No systemd service; you start/stop manually with `pg_ctl`.
* Data directory is wherever you initialize it (e.g., `~/airflow/pgdata`).
* Port: you can pick (e.g., **5433**) so it won’t conflict with any system Postgres.
* Runs only when you activate and start it — fully isolated.

✅ Good if:

* You want everything for Airflow self-contained in one env (no system conflicts).
* You might have multiple environments with different Postgres versions.
* You don’t want root privileges or touching `/usr/lib/postgresql`.

⚠️ Risks:

* You must remember to start/stop manually (`pg_ctl -D ... start`).
* It’s “userland” — not integrated with system services.
* Slightly less common setup, so some guides won’t match exactly.

## 3. **Key difference**

* **WSL apt install** → “system PostgreSQL”, shared, always-on, root-managed.
* **Conda airflow\_env install** → “embedded PostgreSQL”, isolated, project-only, user-managed.

Think of it like:

* Apt version = renting an apartment in a big building (shared utilities, one master switch).
* Conda version = having a portable cabin just for your project (isolated, no neighbors, you control power).
